# Reciprocols

Using basic Number Theory, an investigation of sums of reciprocols.

## Question

__*Is the series of partial sums of reciprocols ever an integer?*__

### Explanation

Consider:

`1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ...`

The partial sum is `S(n) = 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n`

Carried out to infinity, the series does not converge (i.e. it's infinite). But each partial sum is finite. Indeed each partial sum is rational. Is it ever an even integer?

* It's not implausible. For example `1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1` 
* What about `1/2 + 1/4 + 1/6 + ...` ?
* Or `1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 + ...` ?
* Or more geneally a series of 1/n where `n = r mod m`
