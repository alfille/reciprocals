# Reciprocals

Using basic Number Theory, an investigation of sums of reciprocals.

## Question

__*Is the series of partial sums of reciprocals ever an integer?*__

### Explanation

Consider:

\\[ 1 / 2 + 1 / 3 + 1 / 4 + \dots \\]

The partial sum is \\(S(n) = 1 / 2 + 1 / 3 + \dots + 1 / n\\)

Carried out to infinity, the series does not converge (i.e. it's infinite). But each partial sum is finite. Indeed each partial sum is rational. Is it ever an even integer?

* It's not implausible. For example \\(1 / 2 + 1 / 3 + 1 / 6 = 1\\) 
* What about \\(1 / 2 + 1 / 4 +  1 / 6 + \dots\\) ?
* Or \\(1 / 3 + 1 / 5 + 1 / 7 + \dots\\) ?
* Or more geneally a series of \\(1 / n\\) where \\(n = r \bmod m\\)`
