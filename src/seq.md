# Sequences to Sums

Much of the analysis will be on the denominators of the reciprocol sums, so we will make the distinction clearer:

## Sequence

The sequence (of positive integers):

\\[Seq\_n=\lbrace2,3,\dots,n\rbrace\\]

## Sum

Corresponds to the (rational) sum:

\\[Sum\_n=1/2+1/3+\dots+1/n\\]

## Conversion

For clarity, we'll define \\(\mathcal{R}\\):

\\[Sum\_n = \mathcal{R}(Seq\_n)\\]

## Sequence Notation

For a sequence of numbers:

* positive integers
* strictly increasing order (no repeats) \\(n\_1\lt n\_2 \lt \dots\\)

\\[ \mathcal{R} \lbrace n\_1, n\_2, \dots, n\_m \rbrace = \frac{1}{n\_1} + \frac{1}{n\_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{n\_m}\\]
