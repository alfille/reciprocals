# Solution Strategy

We will have partial sums of the form:

\\[ S(n)=\frac{1}{v\_1}+\frac{1}{v\_2}+\frac{1}{v\_3}+\\dots+\frac{1}{v\_n} \\]

Choose a *p* so that 

\\[ S(n) = \frac{a}{b\times p\^e} \quad \text{where}\quad (a,p)=1\quad\text{and}\quad(b,p)=1\\]

Our strategy is to show that \\(p\^e\\) persists in the denominator and slowly increments.

## Math Induction

### Condition I

In the series:

\\[S(1),S(2),\dots\\]

There is a minimal element \\(v\_0\\) where
\\[p\mid S(v\_0) \tag{Condition I}\\]

### Condition II

None of the terms:

\\[S(1),S(2),\dots,S(v\_o) \tag{Condition II}\\]

are integers. (There are a finite number of terms to check.)

### Condition III

The next term \\[ \frac{1}{v\_1} \quad \text{where} \quad p\^e \mid v\_1 \quad \text{also allows} \quad p\^{e+1} \mid v\_1 \tag{Condition III}\\]

Thus there is never a cancellation of the highest power of *p*

I.e. There is always an unique factor in the denomi
