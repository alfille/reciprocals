# Consecutive Sequences

Consider (in [sequence notation](seq.md)):

\\[\begin{split} \mathcal{T\_k(n)} =\mathcal{R} \lbrace n, n+1, n+2, \dots, n+k-1 \rbrace \\\\ = \frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n+1}+\frac{1}{n+2}+\dots+\frac{1}{n+k-1}  \\\\ \text{where} \quad k \gt 1\end{split} \\]

A consecutive sequence of *k* length starting at *n.*

If \\(\mathcal{R\_k(n)}\\) is any squence of length *k* starting at *n* then
\\[ \mathcal{T\_k(n)} \ge \mathcal{R\_k(n)} \\]

since every element of \\(\mathcal{T\_k(n)}\\) is less or equal to the same element of \\(\mathcal{R\_k(n)}\\)
