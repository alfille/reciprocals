# Simple cases

In addition to the original problem 

\\[\lbrace2,3,\dots,n\rbrace\\]

with sum:
\\[ \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\dots+\frac{1}{n}\\] we will try some other sequences.

In every case, we'll use our [strategy](stragegy.md) and

* Choose a *p*
* Show that we can satisfy conditions I, II, III
