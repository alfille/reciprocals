# Integral sequences

The is the converse problem:Find sequences that sum to an integer.

### Example

\\[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = 1 \\]

or in our [sequence notation](seq.md):

\\[ \mathcal{R} \lbrace 2, 3, 6 \rbrace = 1 \\]

## Approach

* Are the number of integral sequences bounded?
* Does it matter which integer is the sum?
* Algorithms for finding sequences.
* Quantitative results.
