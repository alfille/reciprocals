# Sequences to Sums

Much of the analysis will be on the denominators of the reciprocol sums, so we will make the distinction clearer:

## Sequence

The sequence (of positive integers):

\\[Seq\_n=\lbrace2,3,\dots,n\rbrace\\]

## Sum

Corresponds to the (rational) sum:

\\[Sum\_n=1/2+1/3+\dots+1/n\\]

## Conversion

For clarity, we'll define:

\\[Sum\_n \dfn \\]
