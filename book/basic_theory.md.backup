# Basic Number Theory

## Integer Domain

We will be using integers, and by extension rational numbers, exclusively. Number theory has been extended to other domains, but we won't need that.

A brief synopsis of Number Theory, none of it particularly obscure:

## Divisibility

We say that "a devides b" 
\\[ a \mid b \\] 
when integer a devides b cleanly. In other words \\( a \div b \\) is an integer.

More formally, there is an integer "c" so that 

\\[ a \times c = b\\]

### Indivisibility

If a does not divide b, we write

\\[ a \nmid b \\]

For instance

\\[ \text{If} \quad a \mid (b \times c) \quad \text{and} \quad a \nmid b \quad \text{then} \quad a \mid c \tag{A1} \\]

### Sum

\\[ \text{If} \quad a \mid (b+c) \quad \text{and} \quad a \mid b \quad \text{then} \quad a \mid c \tag{A2}\\]

### Product

\\[ \text{If} \quad (a \times b) \mid c \quad \text{then} \quad a \mid c \quad \text{and} \quad b \mid c  \tag{A3}\\]

### Euclid's division lemma

given any 2 integers *a*, *b* there are integers *q* and *r* such that

\\[a = q \times b + r  \qquad  \text{where} \quad  0 \le r \lt b  \tag{A4}\\]

*r* is the __remainder__.

### Modulus
Another way of writing this is using *modulus* ( *mod* operator)
\\[ a = r \bmod b \\]

## Primes

Numbers that have no divisors (except themselvs and *1* are __prime__)

### Fundemental theorem of arithmatic
Every integer has a unique factorization into *primes*. Pretty intuitive, although a formal proof takes some work.

### Greatest Common Divisor

Every pair of integers has a *greatest common divisor*. Formally

\\[ \text{greatest common divisor of a and b:}\quad d \mid a \text{ and } d \mid b \\]
\\[ \text{if } c \mid a \text{ and } c \mid b \quad \text{then } c \mid d \\]
We typically write:
\\[ d = (a,b) \\]

### Relatively prime

If *a* and *b* have no factors (primes) in common then they are __relatively prime__. I.e.
\\[(a,b)=1\\]
